# 3D-Printinga_an_Image
This project focusses on how a simple image file such as JPG, PNG, etc. can be converted into a 3D model. It includes converting the image file into a SVG(Scalable Vector Graphics) and editing it in a CAD environment. The project also compares the normal approach with a different approach that includes an additional step of filtering the image.
